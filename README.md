# DIY-F16-ICP-Panel
A simple, budget, DIY F16 ICP flight control panel for use with flight simulators such as DCS World

**PLEASE READ**

This project is still somewhat a work in progress. While the panel is meant to be almost a perfect replica of the real F16 ICP panel, some of the components are not perfect or are unfinished. For example, the rocker switches at the moment are not yet modelled to have any buttons attached. So far, I have modelled the panel as well as a corresponding stand which is designed so that two cougar MFD's can be attached with additional some additional mounts on either side. I plan on modelling these additional mounts soon and will upload them when complete. The intention was so that the MFD's and the ICP can all be attached as one solid unit. 

I have created a bill of materials as well, so please check that out. Hopefully all of the files are not too difficult to print, at least they werent too much trouble for me. 

I have also included a link to the files on Thingiverse below:
